For given string ‘str’ of digits, find length of the longest substring of ‘str’, such that the length of the substring is 2k digits and sum of left k digits is equal to the sum of right k digits.


Input:

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case contains a string string of length N.

Output:

Print length of the longest substring of length 2k such that sum of left k elements is equal to right k elements and if there is no such substring print 0.


Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 100

Example:

Input:
2
000000
1234123

Output:
6
4


/*Failed Test Case*/
Wrong Answer. !!!Wrong Answer
Possibly your code doesn't work correctly for multiple test-cases (TCs).
The first test case where your code failed:

Input:
740948824551711527614232216857618927954312

Its Correct output is:
36

And Your Code's output is:
